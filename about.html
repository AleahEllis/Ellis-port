		<h1>the about page</h1>
		<h3>Welcome</h3>

		<h4>As you may have discovered on the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page, there are three types of animals that visit this website. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe">Giraffes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl">Owls</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus">Octopi</a>.<h4>
		<p>Suprisingly, giraffes are the most common visitor to this website. The octopus has more advanced motor skills than both the giraffe and owl, making it easier to navigate the web. However less that 20% of our visitors come from the octopodidae family. We think this may be because their underwater location makes it difficult to access the type of equiptment needed to surf the web. Owls are very cool because they are able to spin their heads 365 degrees. They also have arguably better motor skills than a giraffe, especialy in relation to desktop/smartphone or laptop usage. Owls have easier access to the internet than the octopus. However, owl usage of this particular site is relativly low compared to both the octopus and giraffe usage. We attribute this to the general wisdom of the owl. Though its much less intellegent than the octopus, the owl is known for wisdom, and may not have been foolish enough to peruse these pages.<br> The giraffe is our most common visitor and of the three animals, it is the most anatomicaly close to a domesticated cow. With similar intestinal and brain structure as well as similar wandering habits, we can only asssume the giraffe stumbles apon this page in search of leaves and grass.</p>
